    <p>
      Crochet (English: /kro äÀà Ée…™/;[1] French: [k Å…î É…õ][2]) is a process of
      creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn,
      thread, or strands of other materials.[3] The name is derived from the
      French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'. Hooks can be made from a
      variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic. The key
      difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for
      their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the
      next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time.
